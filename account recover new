✅ What You Need to Do
🔁 Step 1: Exit DiskPart
To access the System32 folder, you need to exit DiskPart and return to regular Command Prompt.

In DiskPart, type:

exit
You’ll now be back at a normal X:\> or C:\> Command Prompt (depending on your environment).

🧭 Step 2: Navigate to System32
Now type:

cd /d C:\Windows\System32
Then confirm you’re there:

dir
You should see files like:

cmd.exe
drivers
config
...

how to check net user

To check user accounts on a Windows system using Command Prompt (CMD), use the net user command.

✅ Basic Command to List All Users
net user

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administrator     DefaultAccount     Guest     John
The command completed successfully.
This shows all local user accounts on the system.

✅ Get Detailed Info About a Specific User
To view details about a particular user (e.g., John):

net user John
📋 This will show information like:
Full name

Account active status

Password set or required

Group memberships

Last logon

etc.

\
To activate the built-in Administrator account in Windows using Command Prompt, follow the appropriate method depending on whether you're in normal mode, safe mode, or recovery environment.

✅ Method 1: Activate Administrator from CMD (with Admin Rights)
If you're running CMD as administrator, use:

net user Administrator /active:yes
✅ Successful output:
The command completed successfully.
This enables the hidden built-in Administrator account.

✅ Method 2: Set or Reset Password (Optional but Recommended)
After activating the account, you should set a password:

net user Administrator *
It will prompt you to enter a new password (and confirm). You can also leave it blank by pressing Enter twice — but this is not secure.

✅ Method 3: If You're in Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE)
If you're in the Command Prompt via Windows installation media or recovery mode, the system drive letter (normally C:) might be different.

Step-by-Step:
Find the correct drive with Windows:

dir C:\Windows
dir D:\Windows
dir E:\Windows
Once found, open regedit:
command for user
net user
net user administrator /active:yes
net user administrator newpassword
